PBL TRAINER V1.0 by Nikita Fretay--Bayart (Le kit a nikit / @bqro on discord)

To use: open pbl.html

Contact me if you find any bugs (very likely)

Features I want to add:
-Lists
-Show scramble on a cube when clicked (I already have the code to draw a cube from a scramble)
-Turn this into an obl trainer as well (italian chef code)
